Consumers tech is mobile, yet very few crypto products have made been mobile-first, as a first class experience. That is in part because of how difficult it is to work within the walled gardens of the App Store. But thanks to ingenuity of builders, that is changing. Warpcast, Blackbird and (soon) Zora, Kiosk and others are building mobile-first products onchain. \n\nNote: I‚Äôm defining mobile-first as an app store product vs. PWA because the app store is where the users are, is full featured, and PWA is for power users and lacks some features.\n\n1/",
