This is one of the most important things to help people understand what‚Äôs happening with this new infrastructure layer on the internet.\n\nThe way that most ‚Äúimportant people‚Äù (e.g. MSM, policymakers, people running big financial institutions) filter the concept of ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù is typically hyper narrow ‚Äì it‚Äôs a technology for ‚Äúcryptocurrency‚Äù, which is ‚Äúmostly bad and useless‚Äù, and even as a technology its never been proven to be useful for anything other than constructing online casinos and proliferating scams.",
