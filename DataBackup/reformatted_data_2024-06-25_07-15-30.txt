We're making Flappy Bird NFT: Play Flappy Bird with any NFT from your collection. \n\nSo far the biggest hurdles have been getting webpack to work correctly and having the pipes emanate from the top and bottom edge of the screen — the latter seems to be introduced by the pixel dimensions of the pipe.png asset that it asked me to find online, which it does not properly account for. \n\nAfter a few rounds of chiding we got webpack working ok but wow these pipes don't want to pipe!",

This is one of the most important things to help people understand what’s happening with this new infrastructure layer on the internet.\n\nThe way that most “important people” (e.g. MSM, policymakers, people running big financial institutions) filter the concept of “blockchain” is typically hyper narrow – it’s a technology for “cryptocurrency”, which is “mostly bad and useless”, and even as a technology its never been proven to be useful for anything other than constructing online casinos and proliferating scams.",
